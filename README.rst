Data Science With Python Re-do
==============================

This is a re-do of the work I did for the Coursera `Data Science With Python` course. I originally had that on github as a public repository but then found out that it's a violation of their code of conduct so I made it private. This is an attempt to re-do it with different data sets and therefore different questions (unless it was something I came up with like the final project for the visualization section).

The built pages will be hosted on github `here <https://necromuralist.github.io/data_science_redo/>`__.
